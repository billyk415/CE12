-------------------------
What were the learning objectives of this lab?

The learning objectives of this lab was to be able to create a guessing game
that compares the user's input of the number to the random number generator when
wanting a new round.  Once compared, there will be a point-system, -1 if it is
greater than, +1 if it is less than, and +2 if it is equal to.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?

There were many issues I encountered.  One was trying to figure out 2sc in order
to try to get the negative sign for the game.  The other was originally creating
the greater than comparator, I wanted to make it on one page, however once
completed I had realized it was too sloppy and almost unreadable.  The parts
that were enjoyable of the lab, was slowly building the cases for the
comparators.  

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
One thing I would redesign about this lab to make it better is to probably
not do the negative sign, that was difficult and after reading on piazza still
have a difficult time on grasping the concept.
