-------------------------
The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings
(“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
I created a register to store the value at the end of the loop. It is incremented 
by 1 to know when the loop will end. The range of addresses the strings are stored 
is from 0x10010000-0x10010038. 

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
To learn the commands and how to use and implement mips to create a program. How to 
store memory and call on it. How to create loops and call to other methods in the 
program.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
One issue was figuring out the algorithm of the division and what needed to be printed
out first. The program had to determine if it was divisible by 35 first before 5 and 7.
Creating the loop was the nejoyable part where we branch to different statements if conditional.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Maybe have more time and help to do this program.
