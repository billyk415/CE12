-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
How to create a logic circuit from a truth table. How to have a switch turn on specific
LED lights. Learning about the different MML tools is interesting also, such as senders and receivers
to help clear up room instead of using wires. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Creating truth tables was fairly easy in this lab. I understood how the switches worked.
I did not encounter any issues.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
This lab was doable and not too hard to understand. Prior knowledge
to MML is definitely a plus as it helps make this lab easier.
